That experience led to the formation of Volunteers in Asia (now VIA). He served as VIA’s president during its first forty years, a period which saw the organization expand its volunteer work and, beginning in 1977, offer short-term, focused study programs bringing Asian students to the United States. Now semi-retired, he divides his time between California and Asia. </td>

					<h5>Katie Kirsch</h5>
					<p>My name is Katie Kirsch, and I am a rising sophomore at Stanford. Last year, I joined Design for America (DFA) as Head of Communications and a designer on the Project Team "Engage2Learn," which focused on designing education technology. Our Project Team has now partnered with a start-up company in San Francisco affiliated with the White House Innovation Team, and my teammates and I are hoping to prototype and launch our product next year. I have also taken a few classes in the Stanford d.school and been mentored by designers from IDEO, and starting next year, my Pre-Major Advisor will be David Kelley. Outside of my work with design, I love writing and film. Right now, I’m doing an internship in marketing where I’m learning as much about web development and branding as I can. I’m not exactly sure what my future career will be, but I’m excited to continue working with design and see where things go!</p>
					<h5>Saba Wolf Fazeli</h5>
					<img width="auto" height="150px" src="saba.jpg">
					<p>My name is Saba Wolf Fazeli, and I'll be a sophomore at Stanford this fall. I joined Design for America during spring quarter last year, and I will be supervising / leading the 5 different project leaders we have in charge of each team. I will also be a designer on the Chrysler-sponsored driver safety project. Most of my experience in design thinking has been from the coaching side of things--I interned at the d.school for a summer during high school, working with the leaders of the K-12 lab (an education-focused design initiative) to develop a three day workshop for over 120 teachers from around the world. I come to design thinking as both a 'traditional' designer/fabricator (having spent a lot of time in a metal shop), and as somebody excited to see the lasting impact that imagination can have in our everyday lives--I like to think that I will get a degree in mechanical engineering. Outside of being a huge nerd, I am an avid automobile/motorsport enthusiast (I spend a lot of time under my car), a windsurfer, surfer, swimmer, and water polo player. I look forward to meeting everyone and hearing about your time in XSEL!</p>
					<h5>Tyler Haydell</h5>
					<img width="auto" height="150px" src="tyler.jpeg">
					<p>My name is Tyler Haydell, and this past year I was President of Design
for America at Stanford, a design studio part of a nationwide network
that uses design thinking for local, social problems.  I’ve also lead
an Alternative Spring Break trip that explored the intersection
between international development and design thinking.   Currently,
I'm Co-President of Engineers for a Sustainable World, an organization
that works with NGO's to tackle international engineering challenges.
Through all my endeavors, I work to utilize design methodology for
innovative and sustainable social impact.</p>
